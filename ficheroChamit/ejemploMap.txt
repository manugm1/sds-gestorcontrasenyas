Having a map into a struct, I was expecting that using `new(struct)` I 
would get a full struct initialized (to zero) included the map but it 
has to be manually initialized. 

=== 
package main 

import ( 
        "fmt" 
) 

type version struct { 
        A        int 
        B        int 
} 

type T struct { 
        Name      string 
        Versions  map[byte]version 
} 


func main() { 
        v := version{12, 33} 

        // map manually initialized 
        var t T 
        t.Name = "welcome to Miami" 
        t.Versions = make(map[byte]version) 
        t.Versions[1] = v 

        // faills because the map is uninitialized 
        t2 := new(T) 
        t2.Versions[2] = v 

        fmt.Printf("%T : %v\n", t2,t2) 
}
